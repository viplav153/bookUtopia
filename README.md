# BookUtopia
BookUtopia is a web application that provides users with a convenient and efficient platform to facilitate the exchange of second-hand books.

Users can simply enter their book ISBN numbers into the application, where the Google Book API is utilized to obtain relevant information including book cover, title, author, description, and more.  This information is then populated into an SQLAlchemy postgres database. Twilio API integration allows users to connect via SMS.  Registered users can search for books by title, author, keywords, or zip code, and the Google Map API helps users to visualize the search results. CRUD features allow users to manage their personal booklist.
